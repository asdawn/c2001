Todo list
-----------
#####1. Move the net.c2001 library to github
        At first this library is published on www.c2001.net and Sourceforge. However, these domains might be difficult to access in the future, and github might be a more efficient way, so I move it here.
#####2. Update it, if possible
        This version is for Java 7. Java 8 had removed official ODBC support, so something had changed. Besides, GDAL 2.0+ is released, so I'll try to make time to update it.
