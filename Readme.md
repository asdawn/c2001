net.c2001: Library for spatio-temporal data analysis

GARMF

GARMF: a general framework for association rule mining  

RFL: association rule filtering library/language
-----------
RFL(Rule Filtering Language)  can be used for sorting, filtrating, and evaluating association rules. Once you converted association rules to the required format (see the API document or source code of net.c2001.dm.ar.base.*), you may save the rules to or read them form file, view and export frequent itemsets and association rules, sort and filtrate association rules using different methods, and evaluate rules with lift, novelty and other measures(see the API document or source code of net.c2001.dm.ar.rfl.*), just try it.

Todo list
-----------
##### 1. Move the net.c2001 library to github
At first this library is published on www.c2001.net and Sourceforge. However, these domains might be difficult to access in the future, and github might be a more efficient way, so I move it here.
##### 2. Update it, if possible
This version is for Java 7. Java 8 had removed official ODBC support, so something had changed. Besides, GDAL 2.0+ is released, so I'll try to make time to update it.
